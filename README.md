# #Javascript30 Coding Challenge
#Javascript30 is a 30 days Vanilla JS coding challenge where I will be developing one website each day using Javascript, DOM, JQuery and a few more tools. 
This challenge was taken up in order to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM. 
The projects under this challenge rely heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the page.
